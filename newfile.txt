About *** and ***
*** and *** should be an important part of your daily diet. They are naturally good and contain vitamins and minerals that can help to keep you healthy. They can also help protect against some diseases.
Most Australians will benefit from eating more *** and *** as part of a well-balanced, healthy diet and an active lifestyle. There are many varieties of *** and *** available and many ways to prepare, cook and serve them.
*** and *** are best bought when they are in season. Otherwise try frozen or canned *** as they are just as nutritious and budget-friendly as well.
You should eat at least 5 serves of *** and 2 serves of *** each day. Choose different colours and varieties.
If you are someone who doesnâ€™t look forward to eating *** or ***, start slowly with those you do like. Try serving, flavouring or cooking them in different ways. You can also disguise them in sauces, minced meals or curries.
